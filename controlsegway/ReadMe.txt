AppWizard has created this controlsegway application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your controlsegway application.


controlsegway.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

controlsegway.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

controlsegway.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

controlsegway.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file controlsegway.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file controlsegway.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named controlsegway.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named controlsegway.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The compiler and linker switches have been modified to support MFC. Using the
MFC ClassWizard with this project requires that you add several files to the 
project, including "resource.h", "controlsegway.rc" and a "controlsegway.h" that 
includes resource.h. If you add an rc file to a static library, you may 
experience difficulties due to the limitation that only one rc file may be 
present in a Dll or Exe. This problem may be overcome by including the 
library's .rc file into the parent project's .rc file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
